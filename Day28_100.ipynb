    "6. Find the difference between the strength of both opponents and add one.\n",
    "7. Take that amount away from the loser's health.\n",
    "8. At the end of each round, check the stats of each character to ensure neither of them have died yet.\n",
    "9. When one character dies (they run out of health), declare a winner of the battle!\n",
